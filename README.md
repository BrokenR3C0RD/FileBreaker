FileBreaker

*An actually smart file parser for TypeScript*

FileBreaker is for the people who need to write real file parsers that are easy to read, easy to understand, and that work quickly.

I, personally, have used too many awful "parsing" libraries that just aren't useful. They require more logic than is actually necessary, instead of just letting the parser handle it by itself. The whole philosophy of this library is to make parsers that handle all of the boilerplate, and leave you to write the code that actually handles the rest of it.

Using the parser to encode files isn't the primary focus at the moment, but is planned for the future.
